title: "Develop with Localnet"

## Recommended

Most developers should use the CLI to run a local development network.
It is simpler and more fully featured than just a single node localnet + faucet.
If you want a local stack that works just like a production network
([Node API](/build/apis) + [Transaction Stream](/build/indexer/txn-stream) +
[Indexer API](/build/indexer) + Faucet), this is the option for you.
