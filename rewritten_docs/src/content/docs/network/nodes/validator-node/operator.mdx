If you are an operator participating in the Libra2 network, then use this document to perform the operator tasks such as deploying a validator node and validator fullnode, registering the nodes on the Libra2 community platform, and performing the validation.

<Aside type="note">
  **Both validator node and validator fullnode are required for mainnet** <br />
  For participating in the Libra2 mainnet, you must deploy both a validator node and a validator fullnode.
</Aside>

## Deploy the nodes and register

<Steps>
  1. Read the

     Make sure that your hardware, storage and network resources satisfy the node requirements.

  2. Deploy the nodes

     Follow the detailed node installation steps provided in [**Running Validator Node**](/network/nodes/validator-node/deploy-nodes)
     and deploy a validator node and a validator fullnode.
</Steps>

Note that your nodes will not be running correctly (not syncing, not participating in consensus),
until they're added to the validator set via [staking pool operations](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/staking-pool-operations) (below).

## Connect to Libra2 network

After deploying your nodes, [connect to the Libra2 Network](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/connect-to-libra2-network).

## Set up staking and delegation pool operations

After connecting your nodes to the Libra2 network, establish [staking pool operations](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/staking-pool-operations) to add your node to the validator set.

Similarly, conduct [delegation pool operations](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/delegation-pool-operations) for APT delegated to your validator. Your node will start syncing and participating in consensus.

## Ensure your nodes are live

After your nodes are deployed and configure, make sure they meet [node liveness criteria](/network/nodes/validator-node/verify-nodes/node-liveness-criteria).
