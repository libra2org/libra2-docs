title: "Latest Libra2 Releases"
---

Each Libra2 release can be found on the GitHub site for [Libra2-core releases](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/releases).
Each release is mirrored by the following git branches:

- [Latest Mainnet Release](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/tree/mainnet)
- [Latest Testnet Release](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/tree/testnet)
- [Latest Devnet Release](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/tree/devnet)

Libra2 typically conducts multiple devnet releases for each testnet and mainnet
release. Hence, devnet releases use commit hashes for tracking rather than
version numbers. Testnet and mainnet releases usually have a one-to-one
correlation, meaning each testnet release rolls into mainnet.

Hot fixes are exceptions that may occur in mainnet to address urgent issues in
production. See the [Libra2 Release Process](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/RELEASE.md)
for more details.
