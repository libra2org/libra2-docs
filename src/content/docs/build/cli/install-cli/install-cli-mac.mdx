For Mac, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI is with the package manager `brew`.

# Installation

<Steps>
  1. Ensure you have brew installed https://brew.sh/.

  2. Open a new terminal and enter the following commands.

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     brew update
     brew install aptos
     ```

  3. Open another terminal and run aptos help to verify the CLI is installed.

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     aptos help
     ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  If `brew` does not work for you, you can try the steps here: [Install via Script](#install-via-script) or [Install via Pre-Compiled Binaries](#install-via-pre-compiled-binaries-backup-method).)

# Upgrading the CLI

Upgrading the CLI with brew just takes 2 commands:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
brew update
brew upgrade aptos
```

# Install via Script

<Steps>
  1. In the terminal, use one of the following commands:

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh
     ```

     Or use the equivalent `wget` command:

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     wget -qO- "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh
     ```

  2. (Optional) It can be helpful to add the Aptos CLI to a folder in your PATH, or to add it to your PATH directly.

     - The steps to add a folder to your PATH are shell dependent.
     - You can run `echo $SHELL` to print the default shell for your machine, then google specific steps to add a folder to your PATH for that shell.

  3. Verify the script is installed by opening a new terminal and running aptos help

     - You should see a list of commands you can run using the CLI.
     - In the future, this is a helpful resource to learn exactly how each command works.

# Install via Pre-Compiled Binaries (Backup Method)

<Steps>
  1. Go to the .

  2. Click the "Assets" expandable menu for the latest release to see the pre-compiled binaries.

  3. Download the zip file for macOS.

     1. It’ll have a name like: `aptos-cli-<version>-macOS-x86_64.zip` or `aptos-cli-<version>-macOS-arm64.zip`.
     2. Make sure you choose the right zip file for your computer architecture (x86\_64 for Intel / AMD or arm64 for ARM).
     3. You will likely have to dismiss warnings that this is a suspicious file when downloading.

  4. Unzip the downloaded file.

  5. Move the extracted Aptos binary file into your preferred folder.

  6. Open a terminal and navigate to your preferred folder.

  7. Make ~/aptos an executable by running chmod +x ~/aptos.

  8. Verify that this installed version works by running ~/aptos help.

     You should see instructions for how to use all CLI commands. These can be helpful in the future when you are trying to understand how to use specific commands.

  9. (Optional) It can be helpful to add the Aptos CLI to a folder in your PATH, or to add it to your PATH directly.

     - The steps to add a folder to your PATH are shell dependent.
     - You can run `echo $SHELL` to print the default shell for your machine, then google specific steps to add a folder to your PATH for that shell.
</Steps>

  When using the pre-compiled binaries method, you can update the Aptos CLI by deleting your existing installation, then following the installation steps again.
