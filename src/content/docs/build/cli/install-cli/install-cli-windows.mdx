For Windows, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI tool is via PowerShell script. If that does not work, you can also install manually via pre-compiled binaries. The pre-compiled binaries approach is not generally recommended as updating is very manual.

# Install via PowerShell Script

<Steps>
  1. In PowerShell, run the install script:

     ```powershell filename="Terminal"
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser; iwr https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.ps1 | iex
     ```

  2. Verify the script is installed by opening a new terminal and running aptos help.

     - You should see a list of commands you can run using the CLI.
     - In the future, this is a helpful resource to learn exactly how each command works.

  If you would like to update the Aptos CLI to the latest version via script, you can run `aptos update`.

# Install via Package Manager (Optional)

<Aside type="note">
  When installing Aptos via a package manager, please update it through the same package manager in the future.

### If you have [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed, you can run the following command to install the Aptos CLI:

```powershell filename="Terminal"
scoop install https://aptos.dev/scoop/aptos.json
```

### If you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed, you can run the following command to install the Aptos CLI:

```powershell filename="Terminal"
choco install aptos
```

### If you have [winget](https://winget.run/) installed, you can run the following command to install the Aptos CLI:

```powershell filename="Terminal"
winget install aptos
```

# Install via Pre-Compiled Binaries (Backup Method)

<Steps>
  1. Go to the .

  2. Expand "Assets" to see the pre-compiled binaries.

  3. Download the zip file for Windows.

     - It will have a name like: `aptos-cli-<version>-Windows-x86_64.zip`
     - You will likely have to dismiss warnings that this is a suspicious file when downloading.

  4. Unzip the downloaded file.

     - Move the file to whichever folder you would like to call `aptos` from in the future.

  5. Right click, then copy the path to the executable.

     Ex. `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\aptos-cli-3.1.0-Windows-x86_64\aptos.exe`.

     <Aside type="note" emoji="ℹ️">
       You may want to add this path to your PATH environment variable to simplify calling the Aptos CLI going forward.
     </Aside>

  6. Open PowerShell via the Start Menu.

  7. Verify the installation by running the help command.

     Use the path you copied earlier to call the Aptos CLI.
     Ex. `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\aptos-cli-3.1.0-Windows-x86_64\aptos.exe help`.
</Steps>

<Aside type="note" emoji="ℹ️">
  When installing with pre-compiled binaries, you can update the Aptos CLI by deleting your existing installation, then following the installation steps again.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
  If neither of the above methods work, you will have to build the CLI from source by following these steps: [Install Specific Aptos CLI Versions (Advanced)](/build/cli/install-cli/install-cli-specific-version)
