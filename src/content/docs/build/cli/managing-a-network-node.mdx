title: "Managing a Network Node via Libra CLI"
---

If you are running a [validator node or validator full node (VFN)](/network/nodes/validator-node), you can use the CLI to interact with your node.

Specifically, you can use the CLI to:

1. [Manage staking pools you own](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/staking-pool-operations).
2. [Vote on proposals](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/staking-pool-voter).

Beyond that, you can run this help command to see more specialized commands the CLI can do relating to operating your node:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 node --help
```
