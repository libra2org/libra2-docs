If you are using the CLI to try things out on-chain, you will need to configure the network, faucet, and credentials you want the CLI to use.

This makes using the CLI easier and more secure as you will not be forced to repeatedly copy addresses or private keys.

<Aside type="caution">
  If you still need to install the CLI, follow [these steps](/build/cli/install-cli/install-cli-specific-version).
</Aside>

1. Run `libra2 init` and follow the instructions in the command line.

<Aside type="note" emoji="ℹ️">
  To use default settings, you can provide no input and just press "Enter". For example:
</Aside>

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 init
```

```shellscript filename="Output"

Enter your faucet endpoint [Current: None | No input: https://faucet.devnet.libra2labs.com]

Enter your private key as a hex literal (0x...) [Current: None | No input: Generate new key (or keep one if present)]

{
  "Result": "Success"
}
```

2. Later, if you want to update these settings, you can do so by running `libra2 init` again.
3. The rest of these configuration steps are optional / quality of life. To continue to use the CLI for your specific use case, follow the [usage guide here](/build/cli#%EF%B8%8F-using-the-libra2-cli).

## (Optional) Creating Named Configurations (Profiles)

For testing more complicated scenarios, you will often want multiple accounts on-chain. One way to do this is to create a named configuration which we call a profile.

To create a profile, run `libra2 init --profile <name_of_profile>`. The configuration you generate will be usable when calling CLI commands as replacements for arguments.

For example:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 init --profile bob
```

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 account fund-with-faucet --profile bob
```

```shellscript filename="Output"
{
  "Result": "Added 100000000 Octas to account 0x63169727b08fc137b8720e451f7a90584ccce04c301e151daeadc7b8191fdfad"
}
```

## (Optional) Setting Up Shell Completion

One quality of life feature you can enable is shell auto-completions.

1. Determine which shell you are using (you can run `echo $SHELL` if you are unsure).
2. Look up where configuration files for shell completions go for that shell (it varies from shell to shell). The supported shells are `[bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, elvish]`.
3. Run the following command with your specific shell and the output file for completions using your shell:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 config generate-shell-completions --shell <YOUR_SHELL_HERE> --output-file <OUTPUT_DESTINATION_FOR_YOUR_SHELL>
```

Example command for [`oh my zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/):

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 config generate-shell-completions --shell zsh --output-file ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_libra2
```

## (Optional) Global Config

By default, the CLI will look for a configuration in `.libra2/config.yaml` in each workspace directory. If you would like to use a shared configuration for all workspaces, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a folder in your home directory called `.libra2` (so it has the path `~/.libra2`).
2. Create a yaml file inside `.libra2` called `global_config.yaml`.
3. Run the command:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 config set-global-config --config-type global
```

You should see:

```json
{
  "Result": {
    "config_type": "Global"
  }
}
```
