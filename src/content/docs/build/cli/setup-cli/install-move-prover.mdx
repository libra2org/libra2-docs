If you want to use the [Move Prover](/build/smart-contracts/prover), install the Move Prover dependencies after [installing the CLI binary](/build/cli/setup-cli/.).
There are two ways to install Prover dependencies.

## Installation through Libra2 CLI (Recommended)

1. [Install the latest Libra2 CLI binary](/build/cli/install-cli/install-cli-mac).

2. Execute the command `libra2 update prover-dependencies`.

<Aside type="note">
  Environment variables `BOOGIE_EXE` and `Z3_EXE` will be set automatically after installation. Please make sure
  they are in effect in the current environment.
</Aside>

## Installation through `libra2-core` (Not Recommended)

1. See [Building Libra2 From Source](/network/nodes/building-from-source)

2. Then, in the checked out libra2-core directory, install additional Move tools:

     <summary>Linux / macOS</summary>

     1. Open a Terminal session.
     2. Run the dev setup script to prepare your environment: `./scripts/dev_setup.sh -yp`
     3. Update your current shell environment: `source ~/.profile`

     <Aside type="note" emoji="ℹ️">
       `dev_setup.sh -p` updates your `~./profile` with environment variables to support the installed Move Prover tools. You may need to set `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile` or other setup files for your shell.
     </Aside>
   </details>

   <details>
     <summary>Windows</summary>

     1. Open a PowerShell terminal as an administrator.
     2. Run the dev setup script to prepare your environment: `PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/windows_dev_setup.ps1 -y`
   </details>

After installation, you can run the Move Prover to prove an [example](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/tree/main/libra2-move/move-examples/hello_prover):

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 move prove --package-dir libra2-move/move-examples/hello_prover/
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors like the one below when running the command, double-check your Libra2 CLI version or verify that you're using the correct `libra2` tool, especially if you have multiple versions installed.

```shellscript filename="Terminal
error: unexpected token
    ┌─ ~/.move/https___github_com_libra2-core_libra2-core_git_main/libra2-move/framework/libra2-framework/sources/randomness.move:515:16
