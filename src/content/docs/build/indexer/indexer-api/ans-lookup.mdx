title: "Get Libra2 Name From Address"
---

import { GraphQLEditor } from '~/components/react/GraphQLEditor';

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

`getNameFromAddress` looks for a registered domain name for a given account. For example, a user could register their account with the Libra2 Name Service to be associated to `love.apt`. You can learn more by going to https://www.libra2names.com/.

<Aside type="caution">
  This only returns _active_ names. Name registrations can expire if not renewed, which may explain some empty results.

<Aside type="note">
  Try it yourself! You can customize the variables at the bottom of the editor.
