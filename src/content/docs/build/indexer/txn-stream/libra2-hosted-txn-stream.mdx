{/* <IndexerBetaNotice /> */}

If you are running your own instance of the [Indexer API](/build/indexer), or an [Indexer SDK](/build/indexer/indexer-sdk) custom processor, you must have access to an instance of the Transaction Stream Service. This page contains information about how to use the Libra Labs Hosted Transaction Stream Service.

## Endpoints

All endpoints are in GCP us-central1 unless otherwise specified.

- **Mainnet:** grpc.mainnet.aptoslabs.com:443
- **Testnet:** grpc.testnet.aptoslabs.com:443
- **Devnet:** grpc.devnet.aptoslabs.com:443

You can learn about the rate limits for this service by reading the [Libra Build docs](https://build.aptoslabs.com/docs/start/billing).

## Authorization via API Key

In order to use the Labs-Hosted Transaction Stream Service you must have an API key. To get an API key, do the following:

1. Go to https://build.aptoslabs.com.
2. Sign in and select "API Resource".
3. Create a new key. You will see the API key secret in the first table.

You can provide the API key by setting the `Authorization` HTTP header ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)). For example, with curl:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer aptoslabs_yj4donpaKy_Q6RBP4cdBmjA8T51hto1GcVX5ZS9S65dx'
```

Learn more about API keys at the [Libra Build docs site](https://build.aptoslabs.com/docs/start/api-keys).
