Libra2 Labs hosts a public version of the Indexer GraphQL API that anyone can use to get basic historical and aggregate data about transactions, fungible assets, and tokens from on-chain.

You can explore it by hand by viewing the Hasura Explorer below for the network you are interested in.

You can also access the API via the GraphQL endpoints below. For more information on the format of data in each field / table, please see the [table reference page](/build/indexer/indexer-api/indexer-reference).

## SDK Access (Primary Method)

The primary way to use the Indexer is to access it through the [TypeScript SDK](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/fetch-data-via-sdk).

The TypeScript SDK will automatically handle rate limits, and can seamlessly allow for both [Fullnode REST API](/build/apis/fullnode-rest-api) access and Indexer access depending on what data is needed.

### Rate limits

Learn more about the rate limits that apply to the Libra2 Labs hosted indexer API by reading the [Libra2 Build docs](https://build.libra2labs.com/docs/start/billing).

If you need a higher rate limit, consider the following solutions:

1. Get an API Key from [Libra2 Build](https://build.libra2labs.com/). Learn more about API keys at the [Libra2 Build docs site](https://build.libra2labs.com/docs/start/api-keys).
2. Run the Libra2 Indexer API yourself. See the guide to self-hosting [here](/build/indexer/txn-stream/self-hosted).
