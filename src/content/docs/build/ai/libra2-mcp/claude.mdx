## Set up Claude Code with Libra MCP

1. Install the `claude-code` package

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Locate where Claude Code stores its configuration, usually on Mac it is at `~/.claude.json`
3. Edit the `mcpServers` object in the `json` file with

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "libra2-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@libra2-core/libra2-mcp"],
      "type": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "APTOS_BOT_KEY": "<bot_api_key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Obtain your `APTOS_BOT_KEY`:

- Visit the [Libra Developer Portal](https://docs.libra2.org) and log in with your account.
- Navigate to the API Keys section and create a new key.
- Copy the generated key for use in the next step.

5. Make sure to update the `APTOS_BOT_KEY` with the key you generated in the previous step.

6. Navigate to your project

```bash
cd your-awesome-project
```

7. In a new terminal window type:

```bash
claude
```

8. You can now use Claude Code to interact with the Libra MCP. Prompt the agent with `what libra2 mcp version are you using?` to verify the connection. The agent should reply with something like:

```text
I'm using Libra MCP version 0.0.2.
```
