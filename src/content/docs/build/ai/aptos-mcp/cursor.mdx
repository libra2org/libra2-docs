# Set up Cursor with Aptos MCP

1. Open the Cursor IDE
2. On the project root folder, create a `.cursor` folder
3. In the `.cursor` folder, create a `mcp.json` file
4. Paste this content

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aptos-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@aptos-labs/aptos-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "APTOS_BOT_KEY": "<bot_api_key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Obtain your `APTOS_BOT_KEY`:
   - Visit the [Aptos Developer Portal](https://aptos.dev) and log in with your account.
   - Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new key.
   - Copy the generated key for use in the next step.

6. Make sure to update the `APTOS_BOT_KEY` in the `mcp.json` file with the key you just generated.
