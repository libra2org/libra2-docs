# Aptos Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Aptos Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a server that provides a set of tools, prompts, and resources to help
developers build applications on the Aptos blockchain. It is designed to be used with AI tools like Cursor, Claude Code,
and others that support the Model Context Protocol.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Build Bot Api Key

### Generate a Build Bot Api Key

To be able to make Aptos Build actions like managing API keys, etc., follow these instructions to generate a new Bot API Key to use with the MCP.

- Go to https://build.aptoslabs.com/
- Click on your name in the bottom left corner
- Click on "Bot Keys"
- Click on the "Create Bot Key" button
- Copy the Bot Key and paste it into the MCP configuration file as an env arg: `APTOS_BOT_KEY=<your-bot-key>`

### Supported Interfaces

We've provided guides for Cursor and Claude Code to help you integrate the Aptos MCP into your development environment.
If you're using a different AI tool, follow the steps for your favorite AI tool, and refer to the documentation for
Cursor or Claude Code for examples.
