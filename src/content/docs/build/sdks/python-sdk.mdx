title: "Python SDK"
---

Libra2 provides a lightly maintained official Python SDK. It is available on
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/libra2-sdk/) with the source code in the
[libra2-python-sdk GitHub repository](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-python-sdk).
Much of the functionality of the Python SDK mirrors the [Typescript SDK](/build/sdks/ts-sdk).
The primary purpose of the Python SDK is to help Python developers to quickly
become familiar with Libra2 and as an accompaniment to Libra2 tutorials.

## Installing Python SDK

The Python SDK can either be installed via `pip`, from source, or embedded:

### Install with pip

To install via `pip`:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
pip3 install libra2-sdk
```

The `libra2-sdk` will be installed in the local site packages directory. For
example, on macOS, you will find the `libra2-sdk` in the
`~/Libra2ry/Python/3.8/lib/python/site-packages/libra2_sdk` directory.

### Install from the source code

To install from source:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-python-sdk
pip3 install . --user
```

### Install by embedding

To embed the Python SDK into your existing Python project:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
cd /path/to/python/project
cp -r /path/to/libra2-python-sdk libra2-sdk
```

## Using the Python SDK

See the [Developer Tutorials](/build/guides) for code examples showing how to
use the Python SDK.
