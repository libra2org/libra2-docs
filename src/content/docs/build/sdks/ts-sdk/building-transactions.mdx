Transactions allow you to change on-chain data or trigger events. Generally, transactions follow 5 steps from building to executing on chain: building, simulating, signing, submitting, and waiting.

<Aside type="note">
  For these examples, `libra2` is an instance of the [`Libra`](https://libra2-core.github.io/libra2-ts-sdk/@libra2-core/ts-sdk-1.35.0/classes/Libra.html) client object.
</Aside>

<Steps>
  1. Build

     Building a transaction is how you specify:

     1. **The `sender` account.** <br />This account normally pays the gas fees for this transaction. See [Transaction Sponsoring](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/sponsoring-transactions) to learn how to have another account pay for fees.
     2. **The `function` being called on-chain.** <br />This is the identifier for the smart contract entry function on-chain that will trigger when you execute this transaction.
     3. **The `functionArguments`.** <br />This is any data the function needs to run.

     This can be packaged into a `SimpleTransaction` using `libra2.transaction.build.simple(...)` like so:

     ```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
     const transaction = await libra2.transaction.build.simple({
       sender: sender.accountAddress,
       data: {
     	  // All transactions on Libra are implemented via smart contracts.
     	  function: "0x1::libra2_account::transfer",
     	  functionArguments: [destination.accountAddress, 100],
       },
     });
     ```

     <Aside type="note">
       There is a more advanced format to pass in `functionArguments` called [Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS)](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/bcs-format) format which is how the Libra chain parses function arguments. The SDK converts TypeScript primitives to BCS format behind the scenes via an API call.
     </Aside>

     #### Building Options

     You can customize the way your transaction executes by passing in `options: {...}` when building. Some of the most commonly used options are:

     1. `maxGasAmount` - This caps the amount of gas you are willing to pay for to execute this transaction.
     2. `gasUnitPrice` - You can specify a higher than minimum price per gas to be executed with higher priority by the Libra network.
     3. `expireTimestamp` - This gives a concrete time the transaction must execute by or it will be canceled.

     The SDK provides sensible defaults for these values if they are not specified explicitly.

  2. Simulate (Optional)

     Every transaction on the Libra chain has a gas fee associated with how much work the network machines have to do when executing the transaction. In order to estimate the cost associated with that, you can simulate transactions before committing them.

     <Aside type="note">
       This simulation only requires the `publicKey` of an account since it will not impact the actual state of the ledger.
     </Aside>

     You can execute the simulation by using `libra2.transaction.simulate.simple(...)` like so:

     ```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
     const [userTransactionResponse] = await libra2.transaction.simulate.simple({
       signerPublicKey: signer.publicKey,
       transaction,
     });
     // If the fee looks ok, continue to signing!
     ```

  3. Sign

     Once the transaction is built and the fees seem reasonable, you can sign the transaction with `libra2.transaction.sign`. The signature must come from the `sender` account.

     ```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
     // 3. Sign
     const senderAuthenticator = libra2.transaction.sign({
       signer: sender,
       transaction,
     });
     ```

  4. Submit

     Now that the transaction is signed, you can submit it to the network using `libra2.transaction.submit.simple` like so:

     ```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
     // 4. Submit
     const committedTransaction = await libra2.transaction.submit.simple({
       transaction,
       senderAuthenticator,
     });
     ```

  5. Wait

     Finally, you can wait for the result of the transaction by using [`libra2.waitForTransaction`](https://libra2-core.github.io/libra2-ts-sdk/@libra2-core/ts-sdk-1.35.0/classes/Libra.html#waitForTransaction) and specifying the hash of the transaction you just submitted like so:

     ```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
     // 5. Wait
     const executedTransaction = await libra2.waitForTransaction({ transactionHash: committedTransaction.hash });
     ```
</Steps>

## Full TypeScript Example

```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
/**
 * This example shows how to use the Libra SDK to send a transaction.
 * Don't forget to install @libra2-core/ts-sdk before running this example!
 */

import {
    Account,
    Libra,
    LibraConfig,
    Network,
} from "@libra2-core/ts-sdk";

async function example() {
    console.log("This example will create two accounts (Alice and Bob) and send a transaction transfering APT to Bob's account.");

    // 0. Setup the client and test accounts
    const config = new LibraConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
    const libra2 = new Libra(config);

    let alice = Account.generate();
    let bob = Account.generate();

    console.log("=== Addresses ===\n");
    console.log(`Alice's address is: ${alice.accountAddress}`);
    console.log(`Bob's address is: ${bob.accountAddress}`);

    console.log("\n=== Funding accounts ===\n");
    await libra2.fundAccount({
        accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
        amount: 100_000_000,
    });
    await libra2.fundAccount({
        accountAddress: bob.accountAddress,
        amount: 100,
    });
    console.log("Funded Alice and Bob's accounts!")

    // 1. Build
    console.log("\n=== 1. Building the transaction ===\n");
    const transaction = await libra2.transaction.build.simple({
        sender: alice.accountAddress,
        data: {
        // All transactions on Libra are implemented via smart contracts.
        function: "0x1::libra2_account::transfer",
        functionArguments: [bob.accountAddress, 100],
        },
    });
    console.log("Built the transaction!")

    // 2. Simulate (Optional)
    console.log("\n === 2. Simulating Response (Optional) === \n")
    const [userTransactionResponse] = await libra2.transaction.simulate.simple({
        signerPublicKey: alice.publicKey,
        transaction,
    });
    console.log(userTransactionResponse)

    // 3. Sign
    console.log("\n=== 3. Signing transaction ===\n");
    const senderAuthenticator = libra2.transaction.sign({
        signer: alice,
        transaction,
    });
    console.log("Signed the transaction!")

    // 4. Submit
    console.log("\n=== 4. Submitting transaction ===\n");
    const submittedTransaction = await libra2.transaction.submit.simple({
        transaction,
        senderAuthenticator,
    });

    console.log(`Submitted transaction hash: ${submittedTransaction.hash}`);

    // 5. Wait for results
    console.log("\n=== 5. Waiting for result of transaction ===\n");
    const executedTransaction = await libra2.waitForTransaction({ transactionHash: submittedTransaction.hash });
    console.log(executedTransaction)
};

example();
```

## Summary

Building and sending transactions on-chain involves the following 5 steps:

1. **Build** the transaction.
2. **Simulate** the cost. (Optional)
3. **Sign** the transaction (if the simulated cost seems ok).
4. **Submit** the transaction to the network.
5. **Wait** for the chain to validate and update.

## Explore Advanced Transaction Features

Transactions have a couple of additional features which let them adapt to your needs which you can learn about here:

1. [Multi-Agent Transactions](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/multi-agent-transactions) - Allowing multiple accounts to interact with a single transaction.
2. [Orderless Transactions](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/orderless-transactions) - Allowing for transactions to be executed out of order for easier management.
3. [Sponsoring Transactions](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/sponsoring-transactions) - Have another account pay gas fees for this transaction.
4. [Batch Submit Transactions](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/batching-transactions) - How to send multiple transactions quickly from a single account.
5. [Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS)](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/bcs-format) - The format used to serialize data for Libra transactions.
6. [Composing multiple Move calls with ScriptComposer](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/script-composer) - (Experimental) Building more complex transaction payload that calls into multiple Move functions dynamically.
