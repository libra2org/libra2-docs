For sample code which explains the core concepts of how to use the SDK, see:

- [Fetching Data](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/fetch-data-via-sdk)
- [Building, Simulating, and Submitting Transactions](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions)

Below are additional resources which may be more suited for your individual use case.

## Code Snippets

The [`examples` folder](https://github.com/libra2org/aptos-ts-sdk/tree/main/examples) in the SDK repo has dozens of code snippets you can customize to your needs.

### How to run examples

To run one of the example scripts:

<Steps>
  1. Clone the

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     git clone https://github.com/libra2org/aptos-ts-sdk.git

  2. From the top-level of the package, install all dependencies.

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     pnpm install
     ```

  3. Build the package.

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     pnpm build
     ```

  4. Go to the folder of an example you would like to run.

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     cd examples/typescript
     ```

  5. Install local dependencies.
