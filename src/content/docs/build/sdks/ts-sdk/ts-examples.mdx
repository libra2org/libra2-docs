## Code Snippets

The [`examples` folder](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk/tree/main/examples) in the SDK repo has dozens of code snippets you can customize to your needs.

### How to run examples

To run one of the example scripts:

<Steps>
  1. Clone the

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     pnpm install
     ```

  3. Build the package.

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     pnpm build
     ```

  4. Go to the folder of an example you would like to run.
