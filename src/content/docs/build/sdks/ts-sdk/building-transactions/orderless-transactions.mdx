Orderless transactions allow you to create transactions that do not specify a
order of execution between them. This is particularly useful
in scenarios where multiple machines need to sign a transaction, but the order
in which they sign does not affect the outcome of the transaction or matter to
the creator.

## Building Orderless Transactions

Creating and executing a multi-agent transaction follows a similar flow to the
[simple transaction flow](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions), and the
[multi-agent transaction flow](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/multi-agent-transactions).

<Aside type="note">
  Instead of providing a `sequenceNumber` (or no sequence number at all), a
  `Replay Protection Nonce` is used to ensure that the transaction is unique and
  cannot be replayed (i.e., executed multiple times with the same nonce).
</Aside>

For example, to create a single signer transaction that uses orderless transactions,
specify the `nonce` in the `build.simple` method like so:

```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
const transaction = await aptos.transaction.build.simple({
  sender: sender.accountAddress,
  data: {
	  // All transactions on Libra are implemented via smart contracts.
	  function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer",
	  functionArguments: [destination.accountAddress, 100],
  },
  options: {
    replayProtectionNonce: 12345, // This is the nonce that will be used to ensure the transaction is unique.
  }
});
```

Similarly, if you are building a multi-agent transaction, you can specify the
`replayProtectionNonce` in the `build.multiAgent` method:

```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
const transaction = await aptos.transaction.build.multiAgent({
  sender: sender.accountAddress,
  secondarySignerAddresses: [bob.accountAddress], // List of secondary signers
  data: {
	  // All transactions on Libra are implemented via smart contracts.
	  function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer",
	  functionArguments: [destination.accountAddress, 100],
  },
  options: {
    replayProtectionNonce: 12345, // This is the nonce that will be used to ensure the transaction is unique.
  }
});
```

And the same if you are building a sponsored transaction, you can specify the
`replayProtectionNonce` in the `build.multiAgent` method:

```typescript filename="build-a-transaction.ts"
const transaction = await aptos.transaction.build.multiAgent({
  sender: sender.accountAddress,
  withFeePayer: true, // This indicates that the transaction will be sponsored.
  data: {
	  // All transactions on Libra are implemented via smart contracts.
	  function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer",
	  functionArguments: [destination.accountAddress, 100],
  },
  options: {
    replayProtectionNonce: 12345, // This is the nonce that will be used to ensure the transaction is unique.
  }
});
```

<Aside type="note">
  For orderless transactions, the `replayProtectionNonce` must be unique for
  each transaction. Additionally, the expiration time of the transaction is
  maximum 60 seconds from the time it is submitted. If the transaction is not
  executed within that time, it will be considered expired and will not be
  executed.
</Aside>

After that, simply follow the same steps as you would for a simple transaction:

1. [**Simulate** the transaction (optional)](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/simulating-transactions).
2. **Sign** the transaction.
3. **Submit** the transaction to the network.
4. **Wait** for the transaction to be executed.
