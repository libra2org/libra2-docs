title: "Batching Transactions"
---

The TypeScript SDK has a built-in way to send several independent transactions together in a batch. This can be a convenient tool when trying to execute multiple transactions quickly from the same account.

This can be done with `libra2.transaction.batch.forSingleAccount` as can be seen in the below example.

## Full TypeScript Example

```typescript filename="batch.ts"
/**
 * This example shows how to use the Libra2 SDK to send several transactions in a batch.
 */

import {
    Account,
    Libra2,
    Libra2Config,
    Network,
    InputGenerateTransactionPayloadData,
} from "@libra2-core/ts-sdk";

async function example() {
    console.log("This example will send several transactions in a batch.");

    // Setup the client and test accounts
    const config = new Libra2Config({ network: Network.DEVNET });
    const libra2 = new Libra2(config);

    let sender = Account.generate();

    console.log("=== Addresses ===\n");
    console.log(`Sender's address is: ${sender.accountAddress}`);

    console.log("\n=== Funding sender ===\n");
    await libra2.fundAccount({
        accountAddress: sender.accountAddress,
        amount: 100_000_000,
    });
    console.log("Funded the sender account!")

    // Generate several recipients to send APT to
    const recipients = [Account.generate(), Account.generate(), Account.generate()];

    // Create transactions to send APT to each account
    const transactions: InputGenerateTransactionPayloadData[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < recipients.length; i += 1) {
        const transaction: InputGenerateTransactionPayloadData = {
            function: "0x1::libra2_account::transfer",
            functionArguments: [recipients[i].accountAddress, 10],
        };
        transactions.push(transaction);
    }

    // Sign and submit all transactions as fast as possible (throws if any error)
    await libra2.transaction.batch.forSingleAccount({ sender: sender, data: transactions });
};

example();
```

## Checking The Status of Batched Transactions

In order to tell when transaction submitted in a batch have executed on chain, you must listen to events while the process runs.

```typescript filename="transaction-worker-events.ts"
export enum TransactionWorkerEventsEnum {
  // Fired after a transaction gets sent to the chain
  TransactionSent = "transactionSent",
  // Fired if there is an error sending the transaction to the chain
  TransactionSendFailed = "transactionSendFailed",
  // Fired when a single transaction has executed successfully
  TransactionExecuted = "transactionExecuted",
  // Fired if a single transaction fails in execution
  TransactionExecutionFailed = "transactionExecutionFailed",
  // Fired when the worker has finished its job / when the queue has been emptied
  ExecutionFinish = "executionFinish",
}
```

You can find an example of how to listen to these events [here](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-ts-sdk/blob/main/examples/typescript/batch_funds.ts#L108).
