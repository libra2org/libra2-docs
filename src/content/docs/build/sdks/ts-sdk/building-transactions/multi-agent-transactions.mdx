Multi-agent transactions allow multiple accounts to participate in the logic of a Move contract.

This can be used to require multiple parties agree to a transaction before executing or to use resources from multiple accounts.

## Writing Multi-Agent Transactions

Creating and executing a multi-agent transaction follows a similar flow to the [simple transaction flow](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions), but with several notable differences.

<Aside type="note">
  Instead of `.simple`, multi-agent transaction functions use `.multiAgent`.
</Aside>

<Steps>
  1. Build the transaction by including secondarySignerAddresses with a list of each additional agent.

     <Aside type="note">
       Make sure to replace the `function` field below with your entry function that requires multiple agents to sign.
     </Aside>

     ```typescript filename="multi-agent.ts"
     const transaction = await libra2.transaction.build.multiAgent({
       sender: alice.accountAddress,
       secondarySignerAddresses: [bob.accountAddress],
       data: {
         // REPLACE WITH YOUR MULTI-AGENT FUNCTION HERE
         function:
           "<REPLACE WITH YOUR MULTI AGENT MOVE ENTRY FUNCTION> (Syntax {address}::{module}::{function})",
         // Pass in arguments for the function you specify above
         functionArguments: [],
       },
     });
     ```

  2. (Optional) Simulate the transaction.

     You can simulate the multi-agent transaction to preview the result before submitting it as follows:

     ```typescript filename="multi-agent.ts"
     const [userTransactionResponse] = await libra2.transaction.simulate.multiAgent(
       {
         signerPublicKey: alice.publicKey,
         secondarySignersPublicKeys: [bob.publicKey],
         transaction,
       },
     );
     ```

     The `signerPublicKey` and `secondarySignersPublicKeys` inputs are optional and can be omitted to skip authentication key checks for the signers during simulation. If you want to skip the authentication key check for only some of the secondary signers, you can provide `secondarySignersPublicKeys` with the public keys of the specific signers you want to check, using `undefined` as a placeholder for the others.

     For example, if `bob` and `carol` are secondary signers and you only want to check `carol`â€™s authentication key, you can set `secondarySignersPublicKeys: [undefined, carol.publicKey]`, leaving `undefined` as a placeholder for `bob`.

  3. Sign once for each agent.

     You will combine these signatures in the next step.

     ```typescript filename="multi-agent.ts"
     const aliceSenderAuthenticator = libra2.transaction.sign({
       signer: alice,
       transaction,
     });
     // Bob is a secondary signer for this transaction
     const bobSenderAuthenticator = libra2.transaction.sign({
       signer: bob,
       transaction,
     });
     ```

  4. Submit the transaction by combining all agent signatures via the additionalSignerAuthenticators parameter.

     ```typescript filename="multi-agent.ts"
     const committedTransaction = await libra2.transaction.submit.multiAgent({
       transaction,
       senderAuthenticator: aliceSenderAuthenticator,
       additionalSignersAuthenticators: [bobSenderAuthenticator],
     });
     ```

  5. Lastly, wait for the transaction to resolve.

     ```typescript filename="multi-agent.ts"
     const executedTransaction = await libra2.waitForTransaction({
       transactionHash: committedTransaction.hash,
     });
     ```
</Steps>

## Full TypeScript Multi-Agent Code Snippet

<Aside type="caution">
  The below snippet needs light editing to work properly! (See below steps)
</Aside>

1. Install `@libra2-core/ts-sdk` by running `pnpm i @libra2-core/ts-sdk` or using whichever package manager is most comfortable for you.
2. Update the below snippet to build a transaction that requires multi-agent signing.
   1. Replace the function and parameters below this comment: `// REPLACE WITH YOUR MULTI-AGENT FUNCTION HERE`
   2. This customization is needed as there are no pre-made Libra2 contracts which need multi-agent signatures. If you want to deploy your own example multi-agent contract, you can deploy the ["transfer two by two" example Move contract](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-ts-sdk/blob/main/tests/move/transfer/sources/script_two_by_two.move#L5).

```typescript filename="multi-agent.ts"
/**
 * This example shows how to use the Libra2 SDK to send a transaction.
 */

import { Account, Libra2, Libra2Config, Network } from "@libra2-core/ts-sdk";

async function example() {
  console.log(
    "This example will create two accounts (Alice and Bob) and send a transaction transfering APT to Bob's account.",
  );

  // 0. Setup the client and test accounts
  const config = new Libra2Config({ network: Network.DEVNET });
  const libra2 = new Libra2(config);

  let alice = Account.generate();
  let bob = Account.generate();
  let carol = Account.generate();

  console.log("=== Addresses ===\n");
  console.log(`Alice's address is: ${alice.accountAddress}`);
  console.log(`Bob's address is: ${bob.accountAddress}`);
  console.log(`Carol's address is: ${carol.accountAddress}`);

  console.log("\n=== Funding accounts ===\n");
  await libra2.fundAccount({
    accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
    amount: 100_000_000,
  });
  await libra2.fundAccount({
    accountAddress: bob.accountAddress,
    amount: 100_000_000,
  });
  await libra2.fundAccount({
    accountAddress: carol.accountAddress,
    amount: 100_000_000,
  });
  console.log("Done funding Alice, Bob, and Carol's accounts.");

  // 1. Build
  console.log("\n=== 1. Building the transaction ===\n");
  const transaction = await libra2.transaction.build.multiAgent({
    sender: alice.accountAddress,
    secondarySignerAddresses: [bob.accountAddress],
    data: {
      // REPLACE WITH YOUR MULTI-AGENT FUNCTION HERE
      function:
        "<REPLACE WITH YOUR MULTI AGENT MOVE ENTRY FUNCTION> (Syntax {address}::{module}::{function})",
      functionArguments: [],
    },
  });
  console.log("Transaction:", transaction);

  // 2. Simulate (Optional)
  console.log("\n === 2. Simulating Response (Optional) === \n");
  const [userTransactionResponse] = await libra2.transaction.simulate.multiAgent(
    {
      signerPublicKey: alice.publicKey,
      secondarySignersPublicKeys: [bob.publicKey],
      transaction,
    },
  );
  console.log(userTransactionResponse);

  // 3. Sign
  console.log("\n=== 3. Signing transaction ===\n");
  const aliceSenderAuthenticator = libra2.transaction.sign({
    signer: alice,
    transaction,
  });
  const bobSenderAuthenticator = libra2.transaction.sign({
    signer: bob,
    transaction,
  });
  console.log(aliceSenderAuthenticator);
  console.log(bobSenderAuthenticator);

  // 4. Submit
  console.log("\n=== 4. Submitting transaction ===\n");
  const committedTransaction = await libra2.transaction.submit.multiAgent({
    transaction,
    senderAuthenticator: aliceSenderAuthenticator,
    additionalSignersAuthenticators: [bobSenderAuthenticator],
  });
  console.log("Submitted transaction hash:", committedTransaction.hash);

  // 5. Wait for results
  console.log("\n=== 5. Waiting for result of transaction ===\n");
  const executedTransaction = await libra2.waitForTransaction({
    transactionHash: committedTransaction.hash,
  });
  console.log(executedTransaction);
}

example();
```

## Common Errors

`NUMBER_OF_SIGNER_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH` - This happens when you are attempting to do multi-agent signing for a function which does not require that number of accounts. For example, if you try using multiple signatures for a `0x1::libra2_account::transfer` function - it only expects one address, and so produces an error when more than one is provided.
