import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Multi-agent transactions allow multiple accounts to participate in the logic of
a Move contract.

This can be used to require multiple parties agree to a transaction before
executing or to use resources from multiple accounts.

## Writing Multi-Agent Transactions

Creating and executing a multi-agent transaction follows a similar flow to the
[regular transaction flow](/build/sdks/go-sdk/building-transactions), but with several
notable differences.

<Aside type="note">
  Instead of `client.BuildTransaction`, multi-agent and sponsored transactions
  use `client.BuildTransactionMultiAgent`.
</Aside>

<Steps>
  1. Build the transaction by including libra2.AdditionalSigners with a list of each additional signers.

     <Aside type="note">
       Make sure to replace the `Function` field below with your entry function
       that requires multiple agents to sign.
     </Aside>

     ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
     transaction, err := client.BuildTransactionMultiAgent(alice.AccountAddress(), libra2.TransactionPayload{
       Payload: &libra2.EntryFunction{
         // Replace module and function with your multi-agent function
         Module: libra2.ModuleId{
           Address: libra2.AccountOne,
           Name:    "libra2_account",
         },
         Function: "transfer",
         ArgTypes: []libra2.TypeTag{},
         Args: [][]byte{
           accountBytes,
           amountBytes,
         },
       },
       AdditionalSigners: []libra2.AccountAddress{bob.AccountAddress()},
     })
     ```

     {/* TODO Support simulation of multiagent */}

  2. Sign once for each signer.

     You will combine these signatures in the next step.

     ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
     aliceAuth, err := rawTxn.Sign(alice)
     if err != nil {
         panic("Failed to sign transaction as sender:" + err.Error())
     }
     bobAuth, err := rawTxn.Sign(bob)
     if err != nil {
         panic("Failed to sign transaction as second signer:" + err.Error())
     }
     ```

  3. Combine the signatures with the raw transaction to create a multi-agent signed transaction.

     ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
     signedTxn, ok := rawTxn.ToMultiAgentSignedTransaction(aliceAuth, []crypto.AccountAuthenticator{bobAuth})
     ```

  4. Submit the transaction by combining all agent signatures via the libra2.AdditionalSigners parameter.

     ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
     submitResponse, err := client.SubmitTransaction(signedTxn)
     ```

  5. Lastly, wait for the transaction to resolve.

     ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
     txnResult, err := client.WaitForTransaction(submitResponse.Hash)
     ```
</Steps>

## Common Errors

`NUMBER_OF_SIGNER_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH` - This happens when you are attempting to
do multi-agent signing for a function which does not require that number of
accounts. For example, if you try using multiple signatures for a
`0x1::libra2_account::transfer` function - it only expects one address, and so
produces an error when more than one is provided.
