title: "Go SDK - Fetch Data"

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can use the `Libra` client to get on-chain data using a variety of helper
functions. Specifically, many of the functions listed in the [reference docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/libra2org/libra2-go-sdk)
will retrieve data from on-chain e.g. `Account`, `AccountResources`, `Transactions`.

Hereâ€™s an example showing how to fetch common data you may need in your application:

```go filename="fetch_data.go"
client, err := libra2.NewClient(libra2.DevnetConfig)
if err != nil {
  panic("Failed to create client:" + err.Error())
}

address := libra2.AccountAddress{}
err := address.ParseStringRelaxed("0x123")
if err != nil {
  panic("Failed to parse address:" + err.Error())
}

accountInfo, err := client.Account(address)
resources, err := client.AccountResources(address)
transactions, err := client.Transactions()
```

<Aside type="note">
  Many have optional inputs such as `ledgerVersion` to specify which ledger
  version to query state.

The `Libra` client can out of the box query both network data from
[fullnodes](https://api.mainnet.libra2labs.com/v1/spec#/) and the
[Indexer](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://api.mainnet.libra2labs.com/v1/graphql)
API which contains aggregated and enriched data. If you want to use a custom
query for Indexer API data, you can use `client.QueryIndexer()` like so:

```go filename="fetch_data.go"
	var out []CoinBalance
	var q struct {
		Current_coin_balances []struct {
			CoinType     string `graphql:"coin_type"`
			Amount       uint64
			OwnerAddress string `graphql:"owner_address"`
		} `graphql:"current_coin_balances(where: {owner_address: {_eq: $address}})"`
	}

	variables := map[string]any{
		"address": address.StringLong(),
	}
	err := ic.Query(&q, variables)

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	for _, coin := range q.Current_coin_balances {
		out = append(out, CoinBalance{
			CoinType: coin.CoinType,
			Amount:   coin.Amount,
		})
	}
```

<Aside type="note">
  Note that all values in the GraphQL must be capitalized and CamelCased. To
  convert to direct database field names, use the `graphql` tag.
</Aside>

## Using Move View Functions

You can call view functions which return custom data from on-chain by using `client.View`.

For example, you can look up the network you are using with the `chain_id` view function:

```go filename="fetch_data.go"
viewResponse, err := client.View(&libra2.ViewPayload {
  Module: libra2.ModuleId{Address: libra2.AccountAddress{}, Name: "chain_id"},
  Function: "get",
  ArgTypes: []libra2.TypeTag{},
  Args: [][]byte{},
)

chainId := viewResponse[0]
```

## Ensuring Fresh Indexer Data

Behind the scenes, some requests use the [Indexer API](/build/indexer) to
access data which has been processed or aggregated. That extra parsing can take
a bit of time, so the data may lag slightly behind the latest ledger.

If you want to ensure that the data is fresh, you can wait on a specific version
from the indexer.

```go filename="fetch_data.go"
// Wait on processorName to reach version 12345
err := client.WaitOnIndexer("processorName", 12345)
```
