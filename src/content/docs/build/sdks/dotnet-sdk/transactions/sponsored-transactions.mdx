This section covers how to do sponsored transactions with the Libra .NET SDK.

**It's important that you understand the basics of building transactions. If not, refer to the guide below for more information.**

## Create a Sponsored Transaction

<Steps>
  1. Set up your LibraClient

     Set up your Libra client by adding the `Libra` namespace and instantiating an `LibraClient`. You can use a predefined
     configuration from `Networks` or configuring your own.

     ```csharp filename="Program.cs"  {1-1, 7-8}
     using Libra;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             var config = new LibraConfig(Libra.Networks.Mainnet);
             var client = new LibraClient(config);
         }
     }
     ```

  2. Set up the Accounts

     To create a sponsored transaction, it's important that there is a sponsor and a user. In this example:

     - **The user:** Will be the account that is sending APT to the recipient.
     - **The sponsor:** Will be the account that pays for **gas fees** of the transaction.

     ```csharp filename="Program.cs" {10-16}
     using Libra;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             var config = new LibraConfig(Libra.Networks.Devnet);
             var client = new LibraClient(config);

             // 1. Create accounts and fund it them.
             var user = Account.Generate();
             var recipient = Account.Generate();
             var sponsor = Account.Generate();

             await client.Faucet.FundAccount(user.Address, 100_000_000);
             await client.Faucet.FundAccount(sponsor.Address, 100_000_000);
         }
     }
     ```

  3. Build the Transaction

     You can now build the transaction using the `LibraClient`. In the transaction, its important that you
     enable the `withFeePayer` flag to enable the sponsored transactions.

     ```csharp filename="Program.cs" {9-19}
     using Libra;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             ...

             // 2. Build the transaction
             var transaction = await client.Transaction.Build(
                 sender: account,
                 data: new GenerateEntryFunctionPayloadData(
                     function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer_coins",
                     typeArguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::LibraCoin"],
                     functionArguments: [account.Address, "100000"]
                 ),
                 // It's important to set this flag to true to enable sponsored transactions
                 withFeePayer: true
             );
         }
     }
     ```

  4. Sign the Transaction using both accounts

     Have both the user and the sponsor sign the transaction. This ensures that the sponsor has agreed
     to pay for the transaction and the user has agreed to execute the transaction. When signing with
     the sponsor, the `SignAsFeePayer` method is used instead.

     ```csharp filename="Program.cs" {9-13}
     using Libra;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             ...

             // 3. Sign the transaction with the user
             var userSignature = client.Transaction.SignTransaction(transaction);

             // 4. Sign the transaction with the sponsor
             var feePayerSignature = client.Transaction.SignAsFeePayer(feePayer, transaction);
         }
     }
     ```

  5. Submit the Transaction

     Once the transaction is signed by both the user and the sponsor, it can be submitted to the blockchain. The `LibraClient` can be
     used to submit the transaction.

     ```csharp filename="Program.cs" {9-11}
     using Libra;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             ...

             // 5. Submit the transaction
             var submitTransactionData = new SubmitTransactionData(transaction, userSignature, feePayerSignature);
             var submittedTransaction = await client.Transaction.SubmitTransaction(submitTransactionData);
         }
     }
     ```

  6. Wait for the Transaction to Execute

     After the transaction has been submitted, it will have to process before its committed to the blockchain. The `LibraClient` can be
     used to wait for the transaction to be processed and executed.

     ```csharp filename="Program.cs" {8-9}
     using Libra;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             ...

             // 6. Wait for the transaction to be processed
             var transactionResult = await client.Transaction.WaitForTransaction(submittedTransaction.Hash);
         }
     }
     ```

  7. Print Balances

     After the transaction has committed to the blockchain, you can print the balances of the user and the recipient.

     ```csharp filename="Program.cs" {9-15}
     using Libra;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             ...

             // 7. Print balances
             var userBalance = await client.Account.GetCoinBalance(user.Address);
             var feePayerBalance = await client.Account.GetCoinBalance(feePayer.Address);
             var recipientBalance = await client.Account.GetCoinBalance(recipient.Address);
             Console.WriteLine($"User {user.Address} has {userBalance?.Amount ?? 0} APT");
             Console.WriteLine($"FeePayer {feePayer.Address} has {feePayerBalance?.Amount ?? 0} APT");
             Console.WriteLine($"Recipient {recipient.Address} has {recipientBalance?.Amount ?? 0} APT");
         }
     }
     ```

     The result should look like this:

     ```shellscript
     User 0xffd89f1e2fef8c67cfb1b99d58ea799281f1d1a0a178db49c3eacab2fe7c0735 has 99900000 APT
     FeePayer 0x842ca7d995255ee73186a6793d6bde7c983c528be7b1a25e1614f4eddb744d4c has 99900100 APT
     Recipient 0x823010a52a589ef528d14ebee4a4af56a00f0ae8afba135c9268581a960e21d7 has 100000 APT
     ```

     The user sent 0.001 APT to the recipient leaving the user with 0.999 APT. The sponsor paid
     for the gas fees of the transaction leaving the sponsor with 0.999001 APT.
</Steps>
