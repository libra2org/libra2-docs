## Installation

Libra provides an official lightly supported Rust SDK in the
[Libra-core GitHub](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/tree/main/sdk)
repository. To use the Rust SDK, add the following dependency and patches on the
git repo directly in your `Cargo.toml`, like this:

```toml filename="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
aptos-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core", branch = "devnet" }

[patch.crates-io]
merlin = { git = "https://github.com/libra2org/merlin" }
x25519-dalek = { git = "https://github.com/libra2org/x25519-dalek", branch = "zeroize_v1" }
```

You must also create a `.cargo/config.toml` file with this content:

```toml filename=".cargo/config.toml"
[build]
rustflags = ["--cfg", "tokio_unstable"]
```

The source code for the official Rust SDK is available in the
[libra2-core GitHub repository](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/tree/main/sdk).

## Using Rust SDK

See the [Developer Tutorials](/build/guides) for code examples showing how to
use the Rust SDK.
