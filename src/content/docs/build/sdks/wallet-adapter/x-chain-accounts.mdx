Thanks to [AIP-113 Derivable Account Abstraction](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-113.md), we can manage x-chain signatures flexibly and securely on the Libra network.
This means that any wallet with an authentication function implementation on the Libra chain can submit transactions to the Libra network.

This functionality enables a variety of use cases for dApps, enhancing user experience and onboarding.

### High level flow

When a user enters a dApp that supports x-chain accounts, the interaction and experience feel the same as with any Libra wallet.
The user connects with a x-chain account (e.g., Phantom for Solana) and can view their Derivable Abstracted Account (DAA) details, sign messages, and submit transactions to the Libra chain.

When a dapp submits a transaction using a x-chain account, the wallet adapter utilizes the `signIn` function (defined in the x-chain account standard) for domain verification and security. If a specific wallet does not support the `signIn` method, the adapter falls back to using the default `signMessage`.
The wallet is requested to sign a message to submit a transaction on the Libra network. Once the wallet approves the transaction, it is submitted to the Libra chain, where it undergoes a signature verification process.

### How does DAA work in a x-chain account?

When a user connects to a dApp using the x-chain account adapter, the adapter computes the user's Derivable Abstracted Account (DAA) address and converts the x-chain account to follow the Libra wallet standard interface.
This ensures a seamless interaction with the wallet for both developers and end users.

The computation of the DAA address is done using the `authenticationFunction` and the `accountIdentity`, both of which are defined in the wallet adapter:

- `authenticationFunction`: This is a function that exists on-chain and is used to verify the signature of the x-chain account.
- `accountIdentity`: This represents the identity of the account used in the on-chain authentication function to verify the signature of the x-chain account.
  In the Wallet Adapter, the `accountIdentity` is based on the original x-chain account's public key and the dApp domain (e.g., mydomain.com). The format is:
  `${originWalletAddress}${domain}`

<Aside type="note">
  Since the account identity is based on the dApp domain, it is scoped to the dApp context. As a result, each account has a different DAA address on different dApps.
</Aside>

### How to integrate x-chain accounts in my dApp?

Currently, the adapter supports Solana and EVM chains

<Aside type="note">
  It is highly recommended to use the `@libra2-core/wallet-adapter-react` package for the best experience. Make sure you integrate with the Libra Wallet Adapter by following these [steps](/build/sdks/wallet-adapter/dapp)

  {/* Solana */}

  <TabItem label="Solana">
    The wallet adapter follows the [Solana Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/blob/master/DESIGN.md) to discover wallets.
    Currently, the wallets that have been tested and support cross-chain accounts are:

    |          | Libra Devnet | Libra Testnet | Libra Mainnet |
    | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
    | Phantom  | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | Solflare | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | Backpack | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | OKX      | ✅            | ✅             |               |

    Supporting x-chain accounts in a dApp requires only a 2-step installation process.

    <Steps>
      1. Install the @libra2-core/derived-wallet-solana package

         ```shellscript
         npm install @libra2-core/derived-wallet-solana
         ```

      2. Import the setupAutomaticSolanaWalletDerivation function

         Once you have installed the `@libra2-core/derived-wallet-solana` package, you can import and use it.
         In the same file where you import the other wallets, such as `WalletProvider.tsx`, you can add the following:

         ```tsx filename="WalletProvider.tsx"
         import { setupAutomaticSolanaWalletDerivation } from "@libra2-core/derived-wallet-solana";

         setupAutomaticSolanaWalletDerivation({ defaultNetwork: Network.TESTNET }); // this is the Libra network your dapp is working with

         ...

         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider
          dappConfig={{
             network: Network.TESTNET,
           }}
         >
           {children}
         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider/>
         ```

      3. Set crossChainWallets dapp config prop to true fot the LibraWalletAdapterProvider

         ```tsx filename="WalletProvider.tsx"
         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider
          dappConfig={{
             network: Network.TESTNET,
             crossChainWallets: true,
           }}
         >
           {children}
         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider/>
         ```
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>

  {/* EVM */}

  <TabItem label="EVM">
    The wallet adapter follows the [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) to discover wallets.
    Currently, the wallets that have been tested and support cross-chain accounts are:

    |          | Libra Devnet | Libra Testnet | Libra Mainnet |
    | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
    | Metamask | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | Phantom  | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | Coinbase | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | OKX      | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | Exodus   | ✅            | ✅             |               |
    | Backpack | ✅            | ✅             |               |

    Supporting x-chain accounts in a dApp requires only a 2-step installation process.

    <Steps>
      1. Install the @libra2-core/derived-wallet-ethereum package

         ```shellscript
         npm install @libra2-core/derived-wallet-ethereum
         ```

      2. Import the setupAutomaticEthereumWalletDerivation function

         Once you have installed the `@libra2-core/derived-wallet-ethereum` package, you can import and use it.
         In the same file where you import the other wallets, such as `WalletProvider.tsx`, you can add the following:

         ```tsx filename="WalletProvider.tsx"
         import { setupAutomaticEthereumWalletDerivation } from "@libra2-core/derived-wallet-ethereum";

         setupAutomaticEthereumWalletDerivation({ defaultNetwork: Network.TESTNET }); // this is the Libra network your dapp is working with

         ...

         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider
          dappConfig={{
             network: Network.TESTNET,
           }}
         >
           {children}
         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider/>
         ```

      3. Set crossChainWallets dapp config prop to true fot the LibraWalletAdapterProvider

         ```tsx filename="WalletProvider.tsx"
         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider
          dappConfig={{
             network: Network.TESTNET,
             crossChainWallets: true,
           }}
         >
           {children}
         <LibraWalletAdapterProvider/>
         ```
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That will handle the logic and implementation to include the x-chain accounts as if they were Libra wallets.

#### Submitting a transaction

In most cases, allowing users to submit a transaction with a x-chain account to the Libra chain requires using a sponsor transaction. This is because the x-chain account might not have APT to pay for gas.
Therefore, the dApp should consider maintaining a sponsor account to sponsor the transactions.

```tsx filename="SignAndSubmitDemo.tsx"
import React from 'react';
import { useWallet } from '@libra2-core/wallet-adapter-react';
import { Libra, LibraConfig, Network, Ed25519PrivateKey, PrivateKey, PrivateKeyVariants, Account } from '@libra2-core/ts-sdk';

// Initialize an Libra client
const config = new LibraConfig({ network: Network.TESTNET });
const aptos = new Libra(config);

// Generate a sponsor account or use an existing account
const privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey(
  PrivateKey.formatPrivateKey(
    "0x123",
    PrivateKeyVariants.Ed25519
  )
);
const sponsor = Account.fromPrivateKey({ privateKey });

const SignAndSubmit = () => {
  const { account, signTransaction } = useWallet();

  const onSignAndSubmitTransaction = async () => {
    if(!account) {
      throw new Error("Account is not connected and unable to sign transaction")
    }

    try {
      // Build the transaction
      const rawTransaction = await aptos.transaction.build.simple({
        data: {
          function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer",
          functionArguments: [account.address.toString(), 1],
        },
        sender: account.address,
        withFeePayer: true,
      });

      // Send it to the wallet to sign
      const walletSignedTransaction = await signTransaction({
        transactionOrPayload: rawTransaction,
      });

      // Sponsor account signs the transaction to pay for the gas fees
      const sponsorAuthenticator = aptos.transaction.signAsFeePayer({
        signer: sponsor,
        transaction: rawTransaction,
      });

      // Submit the transaction to chain
      const txnSubmitted = await aptosClient(network).transaction.submit.simple(
        {
          transaction: rawTransaction,
          senderAuthenticator: walletSignedTransaction.authenticator,
          feePayerAuthenticator: sponsorAuthenticator,
        }
      );

      // if you want to wait for transaction
      await aptos.waitForTransaction({ transactionHash: txnSubmitted.hash });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={onSignAndSubmitTransaction}>
      Sign and submit transaction
    </button>
  );
};

export default SignAndSubmit;
```

### Considerations

- Since the origin wallet creates an x-chain account and is most likely not integrated with Libra, simulation is not available in the wallet.
- While the x-chain account prioritizes DAA, each account also retains the origin wallet, so developers should be able to use it and interact with it
