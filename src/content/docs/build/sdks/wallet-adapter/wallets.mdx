title: "Wallet Adapter Plugin for SDK Wallet Builders"
---

A wallet adapter plugin allows dapps to use your wallet. With the AIP-62 Wallet standard, dapps can simply update their version of `aptos-wallet-adapter` to connect to newly added Wallet plugins.



import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';



Implementing a wallet plugin for an SDK wallet which can be imported via npm has three main steps:

1. Implement a wallet adapter plugin for your SDK wallet.
2. Publish your plugin on npm.
3. Update the `aptos-wallet-adapter` package to let dapps know about your wallet.

## 1. Implement the Wallet Adapter Plugin.

You can use the [`wallet-standard`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/wallet-standard) repo’s example to implement an [AIP-62](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-62.md) compatible wallet adapter plugin that dapps can automatically recognize.

<Aside type="note">
  For an example of how to implement the Wallet Adapter plugin, see the [Wallet Adapter Demo dapp](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/tree/main/apps/nextjs-example). Specifically, [`standardWallet.ts`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/apps/nextjs-example/src/utils/standardWallet.ts) contains the plugin implementation, and [`page.tsx`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/apps/nextjs-example/src/app/page.tsx) has the React components.
</Aside>



<Steps>

1. Create a new typescript repository.

2. Copy the  into that new repo.

3. Follow the instructions in that example to make it use your wallet to execute the AIP-62 functions.

   <Aside type="note">
     The full list of required functions for AIP-62 compatible wallets can be found [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/wallet-standard/blob/38defe159b8641ff1763c4db61827c78ab448dab/src/detect.ts#L16).

## Test your changes by:



<Steps>

1. Clone the  repository.

2. Navigate to  in the example dapp.

3. Replace  with your implementation of the AIP-62 standard.

   1. You will have to update the import in [`aptos-wallet-adapter/apps/nextjs-example/src/app/page.tsx`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/apps/nextjs-example/src/app/page.tsx) to use your Wallet instead of `MyWallet`.
   2. For local testing purposes, you can leave the `registerWallet` code, but SDK wallets do not need that once they have been added to the `aptos-wallet-standard` core package.

4. Run a local version of the dapp by following the instructions in the .

5. Click “Connect a Wallet”

   You should see your wallet on the list of connections.

6. Connect to your wallet.

   1. You can then use the demo dapp features to verify your other wallet features work as expected.
   2. This simulates how a real dapp will interact with your wallet.

</Steps>



## 2. Once tested, publish a new npm package for your SDK wallet code by following [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages). (Ex. [AptosConnect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-connect/wallet-adapter-plugin))

## 3. Update [`wallet-adapter-core`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/tree/main/packages/wallet-adapter-core) to know about your extension.

In order for dapp users who are not already using your wallet to get the option to create an account with your wallet, you need to update [`wallet-adapter-core`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/tree/main/packages/wallet-adapter-core) with your browser extension’s download link.



<Steps>

1. Fork the  monorepo. ()

2. Open your fork in a local editor such as VSCode.

3. Create a new branch for your changes.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   git checkout -b your-wallet
   ```

4. Navigate to .

5. Import your SDK wallet npm package.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   pnpm i @yourpackage
   ```

6. Import your wallet in .

   For example with AptosConnect:

   ```tsx filename="Example.tsx"
   import { AptosConnectWallet } from "@aptos-connect/wallet-adapter-plugin";
   ```

7. Add code to push an instance of your wallet to sdkWallets inside getSDKWallets (in sdkWallets.ts).

   ```tsx filename="Example.tsx"
   sdkWallets.push(new YourWallet(dappConfig));
   ```

   <Aside type="caution">
     Some wallets may have custom logic required to make sure the right wallet is connected when the user clicks to “sign in” with your Wallet.

     Ex. T Wallet has different Wallet plugins for mainnet and devnet connections.
   </Aside>

8. In type.ts, update the type AvailableWallets to include your wallet’s name.

   ```tsx filename="Example.tsx"
   export type AvailableWallets = "Nightly" | "Petra" | "T wallet" | "Your Wallet's Name";
   ```

9. Update the  at the top-level of the aptos-wallet-adapter to include your wallet in the list of AIP-62 compatible wallets.

10. Commit and push your changes to your fork.

    <Aside type="note">
      If you have pushed your changes to your fork, a green button should appear at the top of the [`aptos-wallet-adapter`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter) repo asking if you would like to create a pull request.
    </Aside>

11. Follow  to open a pull request for the  repo.

    <Aside type="note">
      Once the changes are merged, dapps that update their `aptos-wallet-adapter` package versions will now be able to see your Wallet.
