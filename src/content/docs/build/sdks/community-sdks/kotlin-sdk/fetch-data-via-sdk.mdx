title: "Fetch Data via the Kotlin SDK"
---

You can use the Libra client to fetch all sorts of data from on-chain such as
information about the network itself or account-specific information.

```kotlin
val modules = libra2.getAccountModules("0x123").expect("Failed to fetch account modules")
val option = libra2.getChainTopUserTransactions(10)
```

Klibra2 returns an `Option` type for all network requests. This allows you to handle
both successful and failed requests in a more idiomatic way.

```kotlin
val ledgerInfo = libra2.getLedgerInfo()
when (ledgerInfo) {
    is Some -> println("Ledger Info: ${ledgerInfo.value}")
    is None -> println("Failed to fetch ledger info")
}
```

If you trust the result exists, you can use the `.expect` function to unwrap the value.

```kotlin
val ledgerInfo = libra2.getLedgerInfo().expect("Failed to fetch ledger info")
```

### Using Move View Functions

You can call view functions which return custom data from on-chain by using the
`.view` method on the `Libra` object.
The user specifies the return type of the view function as a type parameter.

For example, you can look up the supply of tokens as follows:

```kotlin
val inputViewFunctionData = InputViewFunctionData(
      "0x1::coin::supply",
      listOf(TypeTagStruct("0x1::libra2_coin::LibraCoin")),
      emptyList(),)

  val view = libra2
      .view<List<MoveValue.MoveListType<MoveValue.String>>>(inputViewFunctionData)
      .expect("Failed to fetch view")
```
