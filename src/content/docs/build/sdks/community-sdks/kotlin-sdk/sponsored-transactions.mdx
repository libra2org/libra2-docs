import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Kotlin SDK provides support for sponsored transactions also known as fee
payer transactions.

The standard flow for sending a sponsored transaction is as follows:

1. Determine upon **operation** by creating a **Transaction**
2. The **sender signs** the transaction
3. The **fee payer** signs the transaction
4. **Submit** the transaction

## Determine Upon Operation

As we'd already seen in the previous section, you can build a transaction by yourself
using the `buildTransaction.simple` method or use the pre-built transaction builders
like `transferCoinTransaction`. However, in the case of sponsored transactions, you
need to specify the optional `withFeePayer` parameter as `true` in all cases.

```kotlin
val txn = libra2.buildTransaction.simple(
      sender = alice.accountAddress,
      data =
        entryFunctionData {
          function = "0x1::coin::transfer"
          typeArguments = typeArguments { +TypeTagStruct("0x1::libra2_coin::LibraCoin") }
          functionArguments = functionArguments {
            +bob.accountAddress
            +U64(SEND_AMOUNT_UNITS.toULong())
          }
        },
      withFeePayer = true,
    )
```

OR

```kotlin
val txn = libra2.transferCoinTransaction(
      sender = alice,
      receiver = bob.accountAddress,
      amount = SEND_AMOUNT_UNITS,
      withFeePayer = true,
    )
```

## Sign the Transaction

Once you have built a transaction, you (the sender) can sign it using the `sign`
method.

```kotlin
val aliceAuthenticator = libra2.sign(
    sender = alice,
    transaction = txn,
)
```

## Sign the Transaction as Fee Payer

To sign the transaction as a fee payer, you can use the `signAsFeePayer` method.

```kotlin
val signerAuthenticator = libra2.signAsFeePayer(
    feePayer = sponsor,
    transaction = txn,
)
```

## Submit the Transaction

Finally, you can submit the transaction to the network using the `submit` method.

```kotlin
val committedTxn = libra2.submitTransaction.simple(
      transaction = txn,
      senderAuthenticator = aliceAuthenticator,
      feePayerAuthenticator = signerAuthenticator,
    )
```

<Aside type="note" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can collapse the fee payer signing and submitting steps into one by using the `signAndSubmitAsFeePayer` method.

  ```kotlin
    val committedTxn = libra2.signAndSubmitAsFeePayer(sponsor, aliceAuthenticator, txn)
  ```
