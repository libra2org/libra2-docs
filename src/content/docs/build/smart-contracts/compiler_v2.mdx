title: "Move On Libra2 Compiler"
---

The Move on Libra2 compiler (codename 'compiler v2') translates Move source code into Move bytecode. It unifies the architectures of the Move compiler and the Move Prover, enabling faster innovation in the Move language. It also offers new tools for defining code optimizations which can be leveraged to generate more gas efficient code for Move programs.

The Move on Libra2 compiler supports Move 2, the latest revision of the Move language. Head over to the [release page in the book](/build/smart-contracts/book/move-2) to learn more about the new features in Move 2. Starting at Libra2 CLI v6.0.0, this language version and the Move on Libra2 compiler are the default. Note that Move 2 is generally backwards compatible with Move 1.

## Move on Libra2 Release State

Move on Libra2 is in production and is now the default compiler, with Move 2 being the default language version.
