title: "Aptos Error Codes"
---

This page catalogs common errors encountered in the Aptos blockchain and
explains how to resolve them wherever possible. As with all software, the code
itself is the source of truth for error handling and will always contain entries
not found here. Instead, this matrix aims to help you address those errors most
typically found, misunderstood, or both.

For the sources of these errors, see:

- [vm\_status.rs](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/third_party/move/move-core/types/src/vm_status.rs)
- [error.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib/sources/error.move)
- [account.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/account/account.move)
- [coin.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move)
- [token.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token.move)
- [token\_transfers.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token_transfers.move)

Help us update this list by sending pull requests containing the errors you
encounter. If you don't know how to resolve the error, as described int the
_Action_ column, simply leave it blank.

## Frequent Errors

### INSUFFICIENT\_BALANCE\_FOR\_TRANSACTION\_FEE

This means that the highest possible gas used for the transaction is greater than
the balance of APT in the transaction sender's (or fee payer's) account.  To resolve,
please submit with a lower max gas amount, and try again.

For example, if the max gas amount is 1000 gas units, and the gas unit price is `100` octas, the total
APT required in the account would be `0.00100000` APT (`1000 * 100 / 100000000`).  The default is often `200000` gas units which
would end up requiring `0.20000000` APT.  If you are having issues with this, please
reach out to your wallet provider.

### OUT\_OF\_GAS

This means that the transaction used more gas than the sender specified as the max
gas amount for the transaction, and aborted as a result.  To resolve, please
try to increase the max gas amount, and submit the transaction again.

### SEQUENCE\_NUMBER\_TOO\_OLD

This means that the transaction's sequence number in the sender's account has already
been used and committed to the blockchain.  In order to submit a new transaction
to the blockchain, please try and submit it again with a new sequence number.

### SEQUENCE\_NUMBER\_TOO\_NEW

This only occurs in simulation, but means that the sequence number being submitted
is greater than the next sequence number for the account.  Please reduce the
sequence number and try again.
