title: "Compiling Move Scripts"
---

Move scripts can be compiled with the already existing Libra Move compiler in
the Libra CLI. For more on how to install and use the Libra CLI with Move contracts, go to the [Working With Move Contracts](/build/cli/working-with-move-contracts) page.

Once you have the Libra CLI installed, you can compile a script by running the following command from within the script package:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 move compile
```

There will then be compiled bytecode files under `build/` with the same name as
the function in Move.

For example this script in package `transfer_half`, would compile
to `build/transfer_half/bytecode_scripts/transfer_half.mv`

```move
script {
  use std::signer;
  use libra2_framework::coin;
  use libra2_framework::libra2_account;

  fun transfer_half<Coin>(caller: &signer, receiver_address: address) {
    // Retrieve the balance of the caller
    let caller_address: address = signer::address_of(caller);
    let balance: u64 = coin::balance<Coin>(caller_address);

    // Send half to the receiver
    let half = balance / 2;
    libra2_account::transfer_coins<Coin>(caller, receiver_address, half);
  }
}
```

Additionally, there is a convenience function for a package with exactly one
script with the below command:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 move compile-script
```

Providing output like below returning the exact location of the script and a
hash for convenience

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
