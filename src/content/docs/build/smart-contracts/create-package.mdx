  We recommend installing the Aptos CLI before beginning.
  If you haven't already installed the Aptos CLI, see the [CLI section](/build/cli)

<Steps>
  1. aptos move init

     In a new project directory, initialize a Move package by running:

     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     aptos move init --name <PROJECT_NAME>
     ```

     You should now have a Move project that looks like so:

     <FileTree>
       - scripts/
       - sources/
       - tests/
       - Move.toml
     </FileTree>

     <Aside type="note">
       You can also create a Move package from a [template](/build/cli/start-from-template).
     </Aside>

  2. Update Move.toml

     In `Move.toml`, fill in the following key information:

     1. `name`: name of your package
     2. `version`: package version (default is `"0.0.0"`)
     3. `addresses`: Describes which address the module will be deployed to.  These are named addresses that can be used as aliases.  In the below example, we will use `hello_blockchain` as the named address.
     4. `dependencies`: You will likely want to use `AptosFramework` and other [Third Party Dependencies](/build/smart-contracts/third-party-dependencies)

     Below is an example

     ```toml filename="Move.toml"
     [package]
     name = "Examples"
     version = "0.0.0"

     [addresses]
     hello_blockchain = "_"

     [dependencies.AptosFramework]
     git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-framework.git"
     rev = "mainnet"
     subdir = "aptos-framework"
     ```

  3. Add to sources directory

     Add your code in the `sources` directory. Here we have a `hello_blockchain.move` example.

     <RemoteCodeblock permalink="https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/afd3706c17bcccfb39a9d6059aecbfa648ed295d/aptos-move/move-examples/hello_blockchain/sources/hello_blockchain.move#L1-L64" />
