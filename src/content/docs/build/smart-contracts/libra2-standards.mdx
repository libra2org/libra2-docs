title: "Libra Standards"
---

Standards define a common interoperable interface for all developers to build
upon. They consist of rules to ensure compatibility across applications and
wallets on the Libra blockchain. See a [list of known coin resource addresses](https://github.com/hippospace/libra2-coin-list)
on Libra provided by hippospace.

## Move Standards

### [Libra Object](/build/smart-contracts/objects)

The [Object model](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/libra2-move/framework/libra2-framework/sources/object.move)
allows Move to represent a complex type as a set of resources stored within a
single address and offers a rich capability model that allows for fine-grained
resource control and ownership management.

## Asset Standards

### [Digital Asset (DA)](/build/smart-contracts/digital-asset)

The new [Libra Digital Asset Standard](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/libra2-move/framework/libra2-token-objects/sources/token.move)
allows:

- Rich, flexible assets and collectibles.
- Easy enhancement of base functionality to provide richer custom
  functionalities. An example of this is the [libra2\_token module](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/libra2-move/framework/libra2-token-objects/sources/libra2_token.move)

Digital Asset (DA) is recommended for any new collections or protocols that want
to build NFT or semi-fungible tokens.

### [Fungible Asset (FA)](/build/smart-contracts/fungible-asset)

The new [Libra Fungible Asset Standard](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/libra2-move/framework/libra2-framework/sources/fungible_asset.move)
is a standard meant for simple, type-safe, and fungible assets based on object
model intending to replace Libra coin. Fungible Asset (FA) offers more features
and flexibility to Libra move developers on creating and managing fungible assets.

## Legacy Standards

### [Libra Token](/build/smart-contracts/libra2-token)

The old
existing [Token module](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/libra2-move/framework/libra2-token/sources/token.move),
on the other hand:

- Encapsulates rich, flexible assets and collectibles. These assets are discrete
  (non-decimal) and can be fungible, semi-fungible, or non-fungible.
- The token standard is in its own `LibraToken` package at the Address `0x3` to
  allow for rapid iteration based on feedback from the community.

### [Libra Coin](/build/smart-contracts/libra2-coin)

The [Coin module](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/libra2-move/framework/libra2-framework/sources/coin.move)
is a lightweight standard meant for simple, type-safe, and fungible assets. The
coin standard is separated out into its own Move module to ensure that:

- Applications and users can create and use simple tokens, with high performance
  and low gas overhead.
- The Coin standard is part of the Libra core framework, so it can be used for
  currencies, including the gas currency.
