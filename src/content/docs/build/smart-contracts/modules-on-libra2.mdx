import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Libra2 allows for permissionless publishing of [modules](/build/smart-contracts/book/modules-and-scripts)
within a [package](/build/smart-contracts/book/packages) as well as [upgrading](/build/smart-contracts/book/package-upgrades)
those that have appropriate compatibility policy set.

A module contains several structs and functions, much like Rust.

During package publishing time, a few constraints are maintained:

- Both Structs and public function signatures are published as immutable.
- Only when a module is being published for the first time, and not during an
  upgrade, will the VM search for and execute an `init_module(account: &signer)`
  function. The signer of the account that is publishing the module is passed into
  the `init_module` function of the contract. **This function must be private and
  not return any value.**

<Aside type="note">
  `init_module` is optional
  It is only necessary if you want to initialize data when publishing a module for the first time.
