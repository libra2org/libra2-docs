title: "Compiling (Move)"

<Aside type="note">
  Ensure that your [CLI](/build/cli) is up to date before compiling.

## `aptos move compile`

Once you have a package set up, you can compile your Move code by doing:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
aptos move compile
```

If run successfully, you should receive a Terminal output like so

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": [
    "<PUBLISHING_ADDRESS>::<MODULE_NAME>"
  ]
}
```

<Aside type="note">
  You may need to add named addresses, especially for examples.  For example, with the Hello Blockchain Move example, you will need to add the `hello_blockchain` named address:

  ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
  aptos move compile --named-addresses hello_blockchain=default
  ```
</Aside>

## Unpacking Build

Compiled Move packages contain a folder structure that resembles the one below.

<FileTree>
  - build/
    - package\_name/
      - bytecode\_modules/
        - dependencies/
        - module\_name.mv
      - source\_maps/
        - dependencies/
        - module\_name.mvsm
      - sources/
        - dependencies/
        - module\_name.move
      - BuildInfo.yaml
  - scripts/
  - sources/
    - module\_name.move
  - tests/
  - Move.toml
</FileTree>

### `bytecode_modules`

The bytecode modules folder contains the compiled Move bytecode for your module(s) (such as `module_name.mv`).
To learn more about the bytecode and its security features, see [why move?](/build/smart-contracts/why-move)

### `source_maps`

The source maps folder contains source maps (such as `module_name.mvsm`) which allow
users to map the compiled bytecode back to the source code and relevant dependencies.
