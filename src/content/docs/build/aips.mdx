---

Libra2 Improvement Proposals (AIPs) are a way for the Libra2 community to propose
changes, improvements, and new features to the Libra2 protocol. AIPs are designed
to be a collaborative process that allows anyone in the community to contribute
ideas and feedback.

AIPs are documented in the [AIPs repository](https://github.com/libra2-foundation/AIPs)
and are administered by the Libra2 Foundation. Each AIP is assigned a unique
number and goes through a rigorous review process before it is accepted or rejected.

## What do AIPs cover?

AIPs can cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Node protocol changes - Mempool changes, consensus changes, etc.
- Framework (smart contract) changes - New modules, new functions, etc.
- Governance changes - Changes to the way the Libra2 Foundation operates, changes
  to the way AIPs are processed, etc.

## What is this section of the docs mostly about?

This section of the docs is mostly about AIPs that are relevant to developers
and providing FAQs and quick information about them.
