title: "Fullnode Rest API"

import { Aside, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This API - embedded into Fullnodes - provides a simple, low latency, yet low-level way of reading state and submitting transactions to the Libra2 Blockchain. It also supports transaction simulation.
For more advanced queries, we recommend using the [Indexer GraphQL API](/build/indexer).

## Understanding rate limits

As with the [Libra2 Indexer](/build/indexer/indexer-api), the Libra2 REST API has rate limits based on compute units. You can learn more about how the ratelimiting works by reading the [Libra2 Build docs](https://build.libra2labs.com/docs/start/billing).

## Viewing current and historical state

Most integrations into the Libra2 blockchain benefit from a holistic and comprehensive overview of the current and
historical state of the blockchain. Libra2 provides historical transactions, state, and events, all the result of
transaction execution.

- Historical transactions specify the execution status, output, and tie to related events. Each transaction has a unique
  version number associated with it that dictates its global sequential ordering in the history of the blockchain ledger.
- The state is the representation of all transaction outputs up to a specific version. In other words, a state version
  is the accumulation of all transactions inclusive of that transaction version.
- As transactions execute, they may emit events. [Events](/network/blockchain/events) are hints about changes in on-chain
  data.

<Aside type="note">
  Ensure the [fullnode](/network/nodes/networks) you are communicating with is up-to-date. The fullnode must reach the
  version containing your transaction to retrieve relevant data from it. There can be latency from the fullnodes
  retrieving state from [validator fullnodes](/network/blockchain/fullnodes), which in turn rely upon
  [validator nodes](/network/blockchain/validator-nodes) as the source of truth.
</Aside>

The storage service on a node employs two forms of pruning that erase data from nodes:

- state
- events, transactions, and everything else

While either of these may be disabled, storing the state versions is not particularly sustainable.

Events and transactions pruning can be disabled via setting the [`enable_ledger_pruner`](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/cf0bc2e4031a843cdc0c04e70b3f7cd92666afcf/config/src/config/storage_config.rs#L141)
to `false` in `storage_config.rs`. This is default behavior in Mainnet. In the near future, Libra2 will provide indexers
that mitigate the need to directly query from a node.

The REST API offers querying transactions and events in these ways:

- [Transactions for an account](https://api.devnet.libra2labs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_account_transactions)
- [Transactions by version](https://api.devnet.libra2labs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_transaction_by_version)
- [Events by event handle](https://api.devnet.libra2labs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_events_by_event_handle)

## Reading state with the View function

View functions do not modify blockchain state when called from the API. A [View function](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/api/src/view_function.rs)
and its [input](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/api/types/src/view.rs) can be used to read
potentially complex on-chain state using Move. For example, you can evaluate who has the highest bid in an auction
contract. Here are related files:

- [`view_function.rs`](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/main/api/src/tests/view_function.rs) for an example
- related [Move](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/90c33dc7a18662839cd50f3b70baece0e2dbfc71/libra2-move/framework/libra2-framework/sources/coin.move#L226) code
- [specification](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core/blob/90c33dc7a18662839cd50f3b70baece0e2dbfc71/api/doc/spec.yaml#L8513).

The view function operates like the Libra2 simulation API,
though with no side effects and an accessible output path. View functions can be called via the `/view` endpoint. Calls
to view functions require the module and function names along with input type parameters and values.

A function does not have to be immutable to be tagged as `#[view]`, but if the function is mutable it will not result in
state mutation when called from the API. If you want to tag a mutable function as `#[view]`, consider making it private
so that it cannot be maliciously called during runtime.

In order to use the View functions, you need to [publish the module](/build/cli/working-with-move-contracts)
through the [Libra2 CLI](/build/cli).

In the Libra2 CLI, a view function request would look like this:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
libra2 move view --function-id devnet::message::get_message --profile devnet --args address:devnet
{
  "Result": [
    "View functions rock!"
  ]
}
```

In the TypeScript SDK, a view function request would look like this:

```typescript filename="index.ts"
import { Libra2 } from "@libra2-core/ts-sdk";

const libra2 = new Libra2();
const [balance] = libra2.view<[string]>({
  function: "0x1::coin::balance",
  typeArguments: ["0x1::libra2_coin::Libra2Coin"],
  functionArguments: [alice.accountAddress]
});

expect(balance).toBe("100000000");
```

The view function returns a list of values as a vector. By default, the results are returned in JSON format; however,
they can be optionally returned in Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS) encoded format.
