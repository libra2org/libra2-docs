title: "Data Providers"

If you want to access libra2 blockchain data but don't need it in real-time.
We have a few options that will let you access this data using SQL or UIs for building dashboards.
This type of data is often used for analytics since it allows for aggregations.

## Review of data endpoints

Hitting the full node directly will give the latest data (will be missing historical unless it's an archival full node) using [REST API](/build/apis#libra2-fullnode)

Indexer layer on top of this will provide a [GRPC transaction stream](/build/indexer/txn-stream/libra2-hosted-txn-stream)

On top of this transaction stream, we've built out some product logic tables that can be queried through [GraphQL](/build/indexer/)

Since the logic to parse out transaction is [public](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-indexer-processors-v2), some vendors have implemented similar parsing logic to create a subset of tables and made them available to query.

## SQL Tables

Indexer defines several processors that create different database tables.

### Core tables

These are parsed directly from node API response, one option is to split it out into the following tables:

- Blocks - version, block height, epoch, timestamp
- Transactions - version, sender, entry function, gas
- Signatures - signature types, signer, fee payer address
- Events - type and data for events

We store data as table items, resources or modules

- (write set) changes - change index, change type, resource address
- Table items - table key, table handle, key (content and type), value (content and type)
- (move) resources - resource address, resource type, data
- (move) modules - bytecode for deployed modules

## Vendors of off-chain data

Most of our data vendors only provide core datasets.
A [subset of vendors](https://libra2foundation.org/currents/libra2-on-chain-data-capabilities-with-dune-nansen-and-other-providers) is listed below

### Google bigquery public dataset

Provides data through [google public data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/crypto-libra2-mainnet-us)

We also have sample analytics queries [using the above resources](https://github.com/libra2org/explorer/tree/main/analytics)

### Dune

We have a dashboard here: https://dune.com/libra2/libra2-chain-metrics-overview

### Allium

Data source for many downstream vendors such as defillama and rwa.xyz. Raw data is available: https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/supported-blockchains/move-ecosystem/libra2
They also have transfers for stablecoins https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/stablecoins#stablecoin-metrics

### Artemis

They also provide stack tracing of transactions

### RWA.xyz

Data can be found here: https://app.rwa.xyz/networks/libra2
You'll need to make an account to access stablecoin details.

### Flipside

Has pivoted from dashboard vendor to more of a vibe coding tool. https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/home/
