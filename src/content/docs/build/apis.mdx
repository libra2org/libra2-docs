The Libra Blockchain network can be accessed by several APIs, depending on your use-case.

## Libra Fullnode

This API - embedded into Fullnodes - provides a simple, low latency, yet low-level way of _reading_ state and
_submitting_ transactions to the Libra Blockchain. It also supports transaction simulation.

## Indexer

    title="Indexer GraphQL API"
    description="This GraphQL API offers a high-level, opinionated GraphQL interface to read state from the Libra Blockchain.
It's ideal for interacting with NFTs, Libra Objects, or custom Move contracts.
Learn more about the Indexer-powered GraphQL API here."

  <LinkCard
    href="/build/indexer/txn-stream"
    title="Transaction Stream API"
    description="This GRPC API streams historical and real-time transaction data to an indexing processor.
It's used by Libra Core Indexing and can also support custom app-specific indexing processors
for real-time blockchain data processing. Learn more here."

## Faucet (Only Testnet/Devnet)

  <LinkCard

    title="Faucet API"
    description="This API provides the ability to receive test tokens on devnet. Its primary purpose is the development
and testing of applications and Move contracts before deploying them to mainnet. On testnet you can mint at the mint page."

The code of each of the above-mentioned APIs is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-core). As
such anyone can operate these APIs and many independent operators and builders worldwide choose to do so.

### Libra Labs operated API Deployments

[Libra Labs](https://aptoslabs.com) operates a deployment of these APIs on behalf of [Libra Foundation](https://aptosfoundation.org/)
for each [Libra Network](/network/nodes/networks) and makes them available for public consumption.

These APIs allow for limited access on a per-IP basis without an API key (anonymous access). To get much higher rate limits you can sign up for an [Libra Build](https://build.aptoslabs.com/) account.
