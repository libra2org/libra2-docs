The Libra network consists of three node types: validator nodes, validator fullnodes (VFNs), and public fullnodes (PFNs). To
participate in consensus, you are required to run a validator node and stake the minimum amount of utility coins. VFNs and PFNs
are not required to participate in consensus, but they are necessary to distribute blockchain data and enable ecosystem services,
e.g., indexing, querying, and RESTful API services (see [Libra APIs](/build/apis)). VFNs can only be run by validator operators,
while PFNs can be run by anyone. You can learn more about the different types of nodes in the [Blockchain Deep Dive](/network/blockchain) section.

This section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to deploy and operate Libra nodes in different
environments. It also describes everything you need to stake and participate in consensus and governance.
