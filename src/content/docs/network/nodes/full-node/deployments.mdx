title: "Deploy a PFN"

The following guides provide step-by-step instructions for deploying a PFN on the Libra networks.

<Aside type="note">
  **Do I have to run a PFN?**<br />
  If you do not wish to run a PFN, but still want to interact with the Libra blockchain, you can use the REST API
  provided by the Libra Labs' PFNs (see [Libra APIs](/build/apis)). Note, however, that Libra Labs-provided PFNs have rate
  limits, which can impede your development. You can get higher rate limits by creating an [Libra Build](https://build.aptoslabs.com/) account and attaching a payment method. You can also deploy your own PFN
  and synchronize with the Libra blockchain directly, or use a different node infrastructure provider.

<Aside type="caution">
  **Choose a network**<br />
  These guides default to deploying a PFN in the Libra mainnet network, but they can easily be used to do
  the same in other networks (e.g., devnet or testnet network). To do so, check out the desired network branch
  and use the `genesis.blob` and `waypoint.txt` node files for the respective branches:
  [mainnet](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-mainnet),
  [devnet](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-devnet), and
  [testnet](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-testnet).
