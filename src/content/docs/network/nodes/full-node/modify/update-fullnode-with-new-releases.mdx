title: "Upgrade your PFN"

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This document outlines the process for updating your PFN with new Libra releases. All PFNs will need to be updated
when new releases are available. For PFNs running in `devnet`, an additional data wipe step is required as `devnet`
is wiped on every new release.

## Source code deployment

If you run your PFN from the [libra2-core][libra2-core/libra2-core] source code, you can update your PFN by
following these steps:

1. Stop your PFN by running the command below (or killing the `aptos-node` process manually):

   ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
   cargo stop aptos-node
   ```

2. Fetch the latest release appropriate for your network, e.g., `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet`. Be sure to replace
   `[network_branch]` with the appropriate branch name below:

   ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
   git checkout [network_branch] && git pull
   ```

3. Rebuild the binary as you did during the initial setup.

4. If your PFN is running in `devnet`, follow the additional steps in the [Data Wipe and Reset](#upgrade-with-data-wipe-devnet-only) section below.

5. Restart your PFN by running the same deployment command as before. For example:

   ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
   cargo run -p aptos-node --release -- -f ./fullnode.yaml
   ```

### (Devnet) Data Wipe and Reset

<Aside type="caution">
  **Devnet only wipe**<br />
  Only follow these additional steps if your PFN is running in `devnet`. Other networks (e.g., `testnet` and `mainnet`)
  don't require this step (as data is never wiped)!
</Aside>

If your PFN is running in `devnet`, follow these additional steps after stopping your PFN (and before restarting it!):

1. Delete the data folder (the directory path is what you specified in the configuration file, e.g., `fullnode.yaml`).

   - The default data folder is `/opt/aptos/data`.

2. Delete the `genesis.blob` file and `waypoint.txt` file (depending on how you configured it, you might not have this file and may instead have a `waypoint` directly in your configuration file).

3. Download the new [genesis.blob](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-devnet#genesisblob) file and the new [waypoint](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-devnet#waypointtxt).

4. Update the configuration file (e.g., `fullnode.yaml`) with the new genesis.blob and waypoint files.

5. Restart your PFN by running the same deployment command as before.

## Docker deployment

If you run your PFN from a Docker image, you can update your PFN by:

1. Stop your PFN by running the command below:
   ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
   docker compose down --volumes
   ```
2. (Devnet only!) If your PFN is running in `devnet`, delete the entire directory which holds your PFN config and data directory.
3. Re-install and configure those files as during the original setup.
4. Restart your PFN by running the same deployment command as before. For example:
   ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## GCP deployment

If you run your PFN in GCP, follow the steps below to update your PFN. Note: if your PFN is
running in `devnet`, an additional data wipe step is required.

### Upgrade with data wipe (devnet only)

<Aside type="caution">
  **Devnet only wipe**<br />
  Only follow these steps if your PFN is running in `devnet`. Other networks don't require this step (as data is never wiped)
  and we recommend not wiping your data in these networks.
</Aside>

If you are running a `devnet` PFN, follow these steps to update:

1. Increase the `era` number in `main.tf` to trigger a new data volume creation, which will start the PFN on a new DB.

2. Update the `image_tag` in `main.tf` to contain the new release version.

3. Update the Terraform module for the PFN (run this in the same directory of your `main.tf` file):

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
terraform get -update
```

4. Apply the Terraform changes:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
terraform apply
```

### Upgrade without data wipe

If you are not running a `devnet` PFN, follow these steps to update:

1. Update the `image_tag` in `main.tf`.

2. Update the Terraform module for the PFN (run this in the same directory of your `main.tf` file):

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
terraform get -update
```

3. Apply the Terraform changes:

```shellscript filename="Terminal"
terraform apply

# If you didn't update the image tag, terraform will show nothing to change, in this case, force a helm update
terraform apply -var force_helm_update=true
```
