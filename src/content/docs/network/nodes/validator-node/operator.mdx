If you are an operator participating in the Aptos network, then use this document to perform the operator tasks such as deploying a validator node and validator fullnode, registering the nodes on the Aptos community platform, and performing the validation.

<Aside type="note">
  **Both validator node and validator fullnode are required for mainnet** <br />
  For participating in the Aptos mainnet, you must deploy both a validator node and a validator fullnode.
</Aside>

## Deploy the nodes and register



<Steps>

1. Read the 

   Make sure that your hardware, storage and network resources satisfy the node requirements.

2. Deploy the nodes

   Follow the detailed node installation steps provided in [**Running Validator Node**](/network/nodes/validator-node/deploy-nodes)
   and deploy a validator node and a validator fullnode.

</Steps>



Note that your nodes will not be running correctly (not syncing, not participating in consensus),
until they&apos;re added to the validator set via [staking pool operations](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/staking-pool-operations) (below).

## Connect to Aptos network

After deploying your nodes, [connect to the Aptos Network](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/connect-to-aptos-network).

## Set up staking and delegation pool operations

After connecting your nodes to the Aptos network, establish [staking pool operations](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/staking-pool-operations) to add your node to the validator set.

Similarly, conduct [delegation pool operations](/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/delegation-pool-operations) for APT delegated to your validator. Your node will start syncing and participating in consensus.

## Ensure your nodes are live

After your nodes are deployed and configure, make sure they meet [node liveness criteria](/network/nodes/validator-node/verify-nodes/node-liveness-criteria).
