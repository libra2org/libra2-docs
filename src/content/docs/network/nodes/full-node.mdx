title: "Run a Public Fullnode"

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can run your own public fullnode (PFN) to synchronize the state of the Libra2 blockchain and stay
up-to-date. PFNs replicate the entire state of the blockchain by syncing from other Libra2 VFNs and PFNs. PFNs
can be run by anyone. This section explains how to deploy a PFN and connect to an Libra2 network. You can learn
more about the different types of nodes in the [Blockchain Deep Dive](/network/blockchain) section.

<Aside type="note">
  **Default connection to mainnet**<br />
  If you follow the default setup in this document, then your PFN will be connected to the Libra2 mainnet. To connect
  to a different Libra2 network, such as devnet or testnet, make sure you have the correct docker image tag, or source
  code branch if you build the binary directly.

  You can find the genesis and waypoint files for all the networks, here âžœ https://github.com/libra2org/libra2-networks.
