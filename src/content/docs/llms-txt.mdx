## What is LLMs.txt?

We support [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files for making the Libra documentation available to large language models
(LLMs). This feature helps AI tools better understand the Libra blockchain, its Move language, SDKs, and development patterns.

## Available Routes

We provide the following LLMs.txt routes to help AI tools access our documentation:

- [llms.txt](/llms.txt) - Contains a structured overview of Libra LLMs.txt files
- [llms-small.txt](/llms-small.txt) - Provides a condensed version of the documentation, optimized for smaller context windows
- [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) - Provides the full comprehensive documentation for all Libra concepts

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

Use the `@Docs` feature in Cursor to include the LLMs.txt files in your project. This helps Cursor provide more accurate
code suggestions and documentation for Libra development.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot can leverage the information in these LLMs.txt files to provide better assistance when developing Libra applications. You can reference these files in your GitHub Copilot Chat by using the following URLs:

```
https://docs.libra2.org/llms.txt
https://docs.libra2.org/llms-small.txt
https://docs.libra2.org/llms-full.txt
```

### Windsurf

Reference the LLMs.txt files using `@` or in your `.windsurfrules` files to enhance Windsurf's understanding of Libra development.
